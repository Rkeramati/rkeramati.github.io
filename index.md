I am Vice President of AI Research at Two Sigma Investments, where my work focuses on advancing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for application in financial markets. I earned my Ph.D. in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/) in the [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu). My doctoral research explored technical challenges in deploying RL to real-world domains, with emphasis on off-policy evaluation, safe RL, and human-in-the-loop learning.

I am also a Visiting Lecturer at Cornell Tech, where I teach Machine Learning Engineering. My broader research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and the design of safe, reliable AI systems for high-impact applications.
