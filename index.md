I am Vice President of AI Research at [Two Sigma Investments](https://www.twosigma.com), where I develop and apply reinforcement learning for financial markets. I completed my Ph.D. in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu) at Stanford, advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/) in the [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu). My research spans off-policy evaluation, safe RL, and human-in-the-loop learning, with a focus on reliable, deployable systems.

I am also a Visiting Lecturer at [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/), where I teach Machine Learning Engineering. 

Outside work I enjoy skiing in the winter, golfing in the summer, sailing, and mountaineering.
