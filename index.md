Hi,

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Stanford AI for Human Impact](https://twitter.com/aiforhi) lab 
where I'm advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/).
My research is on 
exploration in Reinforcement Learning (RL), safe RL and off-policy policy evaluation. 
I am particularly excited about applications of RL in Health Care.
