Hi,

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford University where I'm advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/). I am affiliated with [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu), [Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://statsml.stanford.edu/index.html) and [Stanford AI for Human Impact Lab](https://twitter.com/aiforhi?lang=en).

My research interest includes Reinforcement Learning (RL), Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I specifically focus on 
Reinforcement Learning and technical challenges that arise when applying it
to real world problems such as health care and education. This involves off-policy policy evaluation, safe RL 
and human-in-the-loop RL.

In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, amateur [photography](/random.md) (also check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/r.keramati/) account), listening to [Pink Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMlFXouPk8) and [Arctic Monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Es-8FfATo).
