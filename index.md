Hi,

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Stanford AI for Human Impact](https://twitter.com/aiforhi) lab 
where I'm advised by [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/).
My research focuses on exploration in Reinfrocement Learning,
and fairness in Reinforcement Learning.

I enjoy reading [NYT](https://nytimes.com),
[backpacking](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/backpacking.htm),
listening to [Pink Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMlFXouPk8) and [Arctic Monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Es-8FfATo)!
And I think Yosemite is the best place on the earth.
